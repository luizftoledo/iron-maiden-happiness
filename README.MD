### How happy can Iron Maiden songs be? ### 

Spotify API has the answer for this question. I have used it with Python/Pandas to measure how happy their songs are and write a short article about it as a project for my Data Studio class for the [Master of Science in Data Journalism](https://journalism.columbia.edu/ms-data-journalism) program at Columbia University.

You can [read](https://github.com/luizftoledo/luizftoledo.github.io/blob/main/iron-maiden-happiness/docs/data_analysis_maiden.ipynb) the full code here. Happiness was measured by the song "valence", which is a value from 0 to 1 that considers how positive a song is, according to Spotify. Only studio albums were considered. Live albums and single were removed from the analysis.</p>
