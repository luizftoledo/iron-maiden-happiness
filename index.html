                        <p>Iron Maiden's happiest songs were released in the 80's and 90's. 
                            Anyone who has listened to the most popular metal band ever probably knows
                             - and enjoys - tracks like Aces High, Running Free, Wratchild and The Trooper
                             , among the happiest songs ever created by the band. After the 2000's the 
                             band became sadder, like in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmx1usEg--k">The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg</a> 
                             or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mywsIR3-4o">The Great Unknown</a> 
                             (from The Book of Souls album). </p>
 
                            <p>This is the conclusion of an analysis using Spotify API data 
                            from every studio album of the band (excluding live albums and singles), 
                            based on the "valence" of each song. According to Spotify documentation, 
                            valence is a "measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness 
                            conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. 
                            happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more 
                            negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry)." Lyrics are not considered.</p>

                            <p>Read the code and data analysis <a href="https://github.com/luizftoledo/luizftoledo.github.io/blob/main/iron-maiden-happiness/docs/data_analysis_maiden.ipynb">here</a>. You might need to <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/quick-start/">create your own Spotify keys</a>
                                to make it work in a separate notebook.
                            </p>
                             
                            <p><strong>Be aware:</strong> this is not science. It's just a simple 
                                data analysis for a class in the <a href="https://journalism.columbia.edu/ms-data-journalism">Master 
                            Science in Data Journalism at Columbia Journalism School</a>. 
                            It's not intended to offend anyone. I'm actually a fan of the 
                            band and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laNdENuz1QY">play</a> in a metal band. :) </p>

<h3>Powerslave: the happiest unhappy</h3>
    <p>Released in 2014, Powerslave is definitely the happiest Maiden album ever. 
    It doesn't mean it is a "happy" album, according to Spotify metrics, 
    as it only reaches half of the happiness bar.</p>
    <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/309KOMEivisMmBuzk09635?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="380" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

<p> By reviewing the songs separately, I found a 
    few that could make Eddie smile (?) - all released between the 80's and 90's.</p>

    <iframe aria-label="chart" frameborder="0" height="431" id="datawrapper-chart-r56Xw" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/r56Xw/1/" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" title="A DataWrapper chart"></iframe>


    <p>Ironically, the happiest Iron Maiden song is Wratchild. 
        It tells the story about a young man who is searching for his 
        unknown father. Does it look sad? Well, listen to the chorus and then compare it to other songs.</p>
        <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1SpuDZ7y1W4vaCzHeLvsf7?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="80" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

        " style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" title="A DataWrapper chart"></iframe>


<p>The top 4 - Lord of Light, Hell on Earth, the Great Unknown 
    and Isle of Avalon were released after 2010, though there are 
    six songs from the 80's and 90's on this list too.</p>
    <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1hgbkiFU5IF8UQz3ca78Qu?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="80" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>
 
    <h3>How happy is an average concert from the band?</h3>
     
    <p>Now let's take a look at how a 
        full concert would look in terms of happiness. 
        I based this chart on an <a href="https://www.setlist.fm/stats/average-setlist/iron-maiden-3bd6803c.html?year=2019">"average setlist"</a> containing 
        the most common song sequence for their shows in 2019 - 
        I didn't find anything from 2020 or 2021, probably due to the pandemic.</p>
    
        <iframe aria-label="chart" frameborder="0" height="431" id="datawrapper-chart-vfOMR" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vfOMR/1/" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" title="A DataWrapper chart"></iframe>


     
<p>So why are there so many sad songs? Do people enjoy it more than the happy ones?
     Spotify data also displays a variable called "popularity", 
     a number from 0 to 100 that reveals how popular a song is at the moment.</p>
 
    <p>There isn't really a pattern. 8 out of their 20 most popular songs 
        are sadder than the average for the band. 12 are happier. 
        If we actually try to do the math with all their songs, 
        we find a very small correlation. Maybe we should just ask the fans.
    </p>

    </script>

<h3>Can you dance while listening to Iron Maiden?</h3>
    
<p>Bonus chart: there's just one song that is suitable for dancing. 
    And Iron Maiden fans hate it.</p>

<p>'The Apparition' seems to be very 
    suitable to dance compared to the others, though 
    you probably will never see Iron Maiden performing it live as 
    they never played it during a concert. Some fans even argue that 
    this is "easily their worst song".</p>

    
    <iframe title="The Apparition is the most danceable Iron Maiden song" aria-label="Range Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-3FmK8" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3FmK8/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="510"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
    </script>
    


    <p>But if you really wanna DANCE, I recommend playing this mega funk version of the Trooper.</p>

    <h3>Methodology</h3>

    <p> I have used the Spotify API to download the data. You can <a href="https://github.com/luizftoledo/luizftoledo.github.io/blob/main/iron-maiden-happiness/docs/data_analysis_maiden.ipynb">read</a> the full code here. Happiness 
        was measured by the song "valence", which is a value from 0 to 1 that considers how positive
        a song is, according to Spotify.
    </p>
    <p>Only studio albums were considered. Live albums and singles were removed from the analysis.</p>
